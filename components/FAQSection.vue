          <p>AI is automating jobs at scale, while investing is becoming the new default way people participate in the economy. I'm building on-chain automations that make investing and trading sophisticated.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">How do AI agents manage money?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Think of them as 24/7 financial co-pilots. They monitor markets, rebalance portfolios, and deploy capital into DeFi strategies or tokenized assets - always with explainability and risk controls built-in. The goal isn't chasing yield, it's building sustainable ownership.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">Isn't it risky to let AI handle capital?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>That's exactly why a human layer is always included. AI generates research, strategies, and actionable proposals — but the owner reviews and approves before anything is executed. It's a balance of AI efficiency with human judgment and accountability.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">Isn't DeFi too risky?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Yes, risk is real - over $2B was lost to exploits this year. That's why the edge isn't just yield, but risk mitigation: AI-driven monitoring, on-chain transparency, diversification, and community governance to protect capital. Security and trust are the differentiators.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">How is this different from traditional investing?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Traditional finance is gated, slow, and extractive. Here, AI handles the complexity, DeFi provides open access, and ownership is shared by the community. It's not just investing - it's participating directly in the future economy.</p>
