          <p>AI is automating jobs at scale, while investing is becoming the new default way people participate in the economy. But most can't access the same tools as institutions. I'm building autonomous AI agents and community-owned on-chain vaults that make sophisticated investing transparent, secure, and accessible for everyone.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">How do AI agents manage money?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Think of them as 24/7 financial co-pilots. They monitor markets, rebalance portfolios, and deploy capital into DeFi strategies or tokenized assets - always with explainability and risk controls built-in. The goal isn't chasing yield, it's building sustainable ownership.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">Isn't it risky to let AI handle capital?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>That's exactly why a human layer is always included. AI generates research, strategies, and actionable proposals — but the owner reviews and approves before anything is executed. It's a balance of AI efficiency with human judgment and accountability.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">Isn't DeFi too risky?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Yes, risk is real - over $2B was lost to exploits this year. That's why the edge isn't just yield, but risk mitigation: AI-driven monitoring, on-chain transparency, diversification, and community governance to protect capital. Security and trust are the differentiators.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">Who can participate?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Anyone with a wallet. We're building vaults that are community-owned, permissionless, and designed for retail investors who want to become owners before AI closes the gap between institutions and individuals.</p>

        <div class="collapse-title text-lg font-medium">How is this different from traditional investing?</div>
        <div class="collapse-content opacity-80">
          <p>Traditional finance is gated, slow, and extractive. Here, AI handles the complexity, DeFi provides open access, and ownership is shared by the community. It's not just investing - it's participating directly in the future economy.</p>
